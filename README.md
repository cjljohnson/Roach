# JGAW - Java Gwent API Wrapper

Java Wrapper library for https://gwentapi.com/ 

Written using retrofit2.

This library executes everything sequentially and takes no regard in terms of threading. If you are using this in an Android app, then I suggest using something like RxJava to handle the networking.
